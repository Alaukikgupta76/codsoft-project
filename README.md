CodSoft Internship Projects - Python
Welcome to my project showcase for the CodSoft Internship Program!
Over the course of this internship, I developed a series of Python-based mini projects that reflect my understanding of programming fundamentals and my ability to apply them to real-world scenarios.

This repository brings together all the tasks I completed during the internship, each focusing on a different aspect of core Python development — from file handling and control structures to basic GUI applications.

🚀 Tech Overview
Programming Language: Python 3

Editor & Tools: Visual Studio Code, GitHub

Core Concepts Applied:

User Input & Output Handling

Loops, Conditions, and Functions

Working with Lists & Dictionaries

File Read/Write Operations

GUI basics using Tkinter

📁 Projects Included
📌 Task 1: Command-Line To-Do List
A simple terminal-based task manager that lets users keep track of their daily activities.
🔧 Features:

Add, view, and remove tasks

Stores task data using plain text files

✅ Use Case: A lightweight productivity tool to manage tasks without needing a full-fledged app.

📌 Task 2: Basic Calculator
A functional calculator designed to perform basic arithmetic operations.
🔧 Features:

Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

Input validation and error handling included

✅ Learning Goal: Strengthened my understanding of functions and user-driven program flow.

📌 Task 3: Secure Password Generator
A dynamic password generator that creates complex passwords based on user input.
🔧 Features:

Mixes upper/lowercase characters, numbers, and symbols

Customizable password length

✅ Why This Matters: Strong passwords are essential, and this tool demonstrates practical Python usage in cybersecurity.

📌 Task 4: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
A fun interactive game between the user and computer with real-time result logic.
🔧 Features:

Computer choices generated randomly

Score tracking and replay option

✅ Skills Used: Randomization, conditional logic, and loop control.

📌 Task 5: Contact Book (CLI Application)
A mini contact management system with a simple interface for managing contacts.
🔧 Features:

Add, search, update, and delete contacts

All data stored using Python dictionaries

✅ Real-World Application: Mimics functionality of basic phonebook apps, built purely with Python.

🎯 Internship Reflection
The CodSoft Internship was a hands-on experience that allowed me to translate coding knowledge into practical applications. These projects helped me:

Build confidence in writing modular and readable code

Explore Python’s standard libraries more deeply

Understand how to approach and solve everyday programming challenges

Learn to use Git and GitHub to track and manage code effectively

Each task pushed me to think critically and code creatively — turning concepts into something I could actually use or show.
